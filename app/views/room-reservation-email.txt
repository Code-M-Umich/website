SUBJECT: [Code-M] Room Request for Code-M Event
FROM: {{ sendEmail }}

Hi {{ recipientName }},

We are looking to reserve a room on {{ eventDate }} at {{ startTime }} until {{ endTime }} in {{ room }}, {{ building }}. If that isn't possible, we can work with something between {{ startRange }} and {{ endRange }} (with the event being {{ duration }} hours). The ideal room would be a {{ roomSize }} sized room in {{ building }}.

Thanks,
Code-M
